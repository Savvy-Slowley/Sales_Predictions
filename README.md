# Overview

This project will be a sales prediction for food items sold at various stores. I will demostrate decision making through data cleaning, complete any statistical analyses that might help you understand, explain, or model with your data.build several data visualizations to help your stakeholders better understand trends in the data.your task is to use Linear Regression to create and evaluate a model to predict sales:

Use the data you have cleaned in previous weeks. 
Spend time transforming your categorical variables into numbers and use dummy encoding where appropriate.
Here are some resources to use when dealing with categorical variables:
Dealing with categorical features in machine learning
Categorical Data
Hereâ€™s All you Need to Know About Encoding Categorical Data (with Python code)
Assign the "Item_Outlet_Sales" column as your target and the rest of the variables as your features matrix.  
Be sure to train test split your data set!
Build a linear regression model.
Evaluate your test set results using r2.
Evaluate your test set results using RMSE
Which features are most associated with higher predicted sales?
Your task is to build tree based models to predict sales and compare evaluation metrics for regression problems.  

Build and evaluate a simple decision tree model.
Build and evaluate a bagged tree model.
Build and evaluate a random forest model.  
You now have tried at least 4 models on this data set (including the regression model from last week).  Compare the performance of your models based on r^2.
Compare the performance of your models based on rmse.  
Overall, which model do you recommend?
